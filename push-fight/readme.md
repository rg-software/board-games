## Rules Summary

- The game is played between the _White_ and the _Brown_ teams consisting of four pieces each. There are three cubic and two round-shaped pieces in each team.

- Both players start with positioning their pieces freely on their respective sides of the custom-shaped 2D board.



TO START: The player with the white team chooses one side of the thick center line and positions the white pieces on that sideof the line.  
Most players will put 4 pieces at the center line, but you don't have to do that.  
Next, the player withthe brown team positions the brown pieces on the other side of the center line.

TO PLAY:Players take turns moving their pieces into position for an attack, then using one of their square pieces to push onespace.  
You can push pieces to a new space, or you can push one of them off the board to win the game.  
Move orpush forward, backward or sideways (in either direction).  

NO DIAGONAL MOVES OR PUSHES ARE ALLOWED.A move can travel several spaces. A push is only one space.

WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN: Players take turns with the white team going first. One turn consists of 2 MOVES (maximum), then A PUSH.

1) 2 MOVES: You can start your turn by positioning 2 of your pieces.  Just move them on empty spaces.  Move onepiece (round or square) and leave it.  
Then, move a second piece (round or square) and leave it.  Travel as far asyou want on empty spaces as long as the spaces are connected (have sides that touch).  
Move all over the board ifyou like.  You can move 1 or 2 pieces, or you can decide to not move any pieces during your turn.

2) A PUSH: Now use one of your square pieces to push ONE space.  
You MUST push one or more pieces with asquare piece to complete your turn.  
You can push white and/or brown pieces in any direction (except diagonally).
If several pieces are lined up in the direction you are pushing, and there are no empty spaces between them, youcan push them all one space. 
Round pieces cannot push.

Note: Be sure each piece is somewhat centered on its new space after a push.

AFTER YOU PUSH, put the red ANCHOR game piece on the square piece that did the pushing.  The anchored piececan't be pushed during your opponent's next turn.  
It is the only piece he or she can't push. If it's in a line ofpieces, none of them can be pushed if it means pushing the anchored piece.  
Once the anchor is put on anothergame piece, the piece that was anchored can be pushed again.  

PLAYERS SHARE ONE ANCHOR.TO WIN: Trap your opponent so you can push one of their pieces off the board at either end.  
When one piece isoff the board, the game is over.  There are a lot of places at each end of the board where you can push them off.
You can also win if your opponent surrenders because he or she is trapped and can't get out.
